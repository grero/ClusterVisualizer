implementations:
- cluster merging
    - works in a certain fashion. Left to do: make system take colors from the cluster and not the initial load
- select points
- display number of points in each cluster
- display mean waveform
- show Xcorr between clusters
- show isi
    - show pair of waveforms with minimum ISI
- compare waveforms
    - compare real and fake waveforms

(- Fix problem with glMapBuffer returning NULL. Could be related to low system memory, but could also be something else. The only thing I changed
was to change cluster indexing from normal GLUint arrays to NSIndexSet. The reason for this is that it will make things like intersection and
set differences easier.) FIXED (Cause: I wasn't unmapping the buffer if new_size==0)
