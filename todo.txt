implementations:
- cluster merging
    - works in a certain fashion. Left to do: make system take colors from the cluster and not the initial load
- select points
- display number of points in each cluster
- display mean waveform
- show Xcorr between clusters
- show isi
    - show pair of waveforms with minimum ISI
- compare waveforms
    - compare real and fake waveforms

(- Fix problem with glMapBuffer returning NULL. Could be related to low system memory, but could also be something else. The only thing I changed
was to change cluster indexing from normal GLUint arrays to NSIndexSet. The reason for this is that it will make things like intersection and
set differences easier.) FIXED (Cause: I wasn't unmapping the buffer if new_size==0)

- Change Array Controller such that only valid clusters are drawn. This amounts to given each cluster an additional boolean property indicating 
whether the cluster is valid or not. To get the Array Controller to only display valid clusters, we can create a predicate which checks the valid
property of each cluster, filters the clusters accordingly.
    - Something a bit strange.. apparently, I can't merge clusters that are already merged..
    
    

- In the process of rewriting the feature loading to be more general. Make sure a single group is selected, by explicitly selecting the file, rather than just the directory
